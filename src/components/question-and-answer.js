                        <p className="questions-paragraph">In 2017, I was selected as an Edie Windsor Coding Scholar, which kick-started my journey as a developer.</p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">Being a developer has provided me with the ability to leverage my previous professional experiences and business acumen to build real-life solutions for everyday problems to improve people’s quality of life.</p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">Programming is fun to me because I enjoy the process of problem solving and I love creating through logic and structure.

                        How does your past experience make you a good developer?

                    <div className="questions-content">
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">Throughout my five years of professional experiences, I developed transferable skills that make me a productive developer.</p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">I developed reliable interpersonal skills. For instance, when I was managing a financial audit engagement, my Senior Manager approached me and asked for help. She needed to track down documents that were critical to completing the audit. The deadline was the next day.</p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">Typically, the turnaround time was 3 to 5-days to get support. Since I had worked with the client for the past few months and had intimate knowledge of the business, I quickly identified the key person to talk to. I took the initiative to gather the support from him.</p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">
                        Due to the strong strategic relationship I had built in the past, I was able to meet him that day despite his busy schedule. I conveyed the importance of obtaining the documents and convinced him to provide the support immediately. As a result, he put my request as his first priority and sent the documents the same day.</p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">I built strong analytical skills. I routinely performed analysis on financial data to identify trends and discrepancies. During one engagement, my analysis resulted in identifying a $1.5 million misstatement in a company’s revenue recognition. My analysis prevented them from incurring future costs and losing investors if the misstatement was not fixed. </p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">I gained strategic vision. My previous positions allowed me to work with people across functions and levels, from staff to Executives. As a result, I have first-hand experience on how big and small companies operate and how I can align the company’s strategies with day-to-day operations. </p>
                        <p className="questions-paragraph">
                        For example, one client was looking for ways to cut operational costs. While working with them, I identified inefficiencies in their recordkeeping that was also impacting our ability to perform a timely audit. I created standardized accounting templates to replace their manual process, resulting in a 104% increase in client productivity and securing our engagement with the client the following years.</p>
